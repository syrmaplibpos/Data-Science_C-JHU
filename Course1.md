### Week 1  Data Science Fundamentals
Learning Objectives
* Define data science
* Define data
* Use resources to get help with problems

#### Welcome to the Data Scientist's Toolbox



#### What is data science


* Data science is using data to answer questions.
Data science can involve:
Statistics, computer science, mathematics
Data cleaning and formatting
Data visualization

* Data scientist is someone who use data to answer questions.
An Economist Special Report sums up this melange of skills well - they state that a data scientist is broadly defined as someone:
“who combines the skills of software programmer, statistician and storyteller slash artist to extract the nuggets of gold hidden under mountains of data”

#### What is data
* Two definitions of data, one that focuses on the actions surrounding data, and another on what comprises data.  
Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making. --Cambridge English Dictionary  
A set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables. --Wikipedia  
Set: In statistics, the population you are trying to discover something out.  
Variable: Measurements or characteristics of an item  
Qualitative variables: Measurements or information about qualities, described by words, not numbers, and they are not necessarily ordered  
Quantitative variables: Measurements or information about quantities or numerical items, described by numbers and are measured on a continuous, ordered scale

* The relationship between data and your question and emphasize the importance of question-first strategies. You could have all the data you could ever hope for, but if you don’t have a question to start, the data is useless.

#### Getting help

https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/discussions

tutorials, FAQs, or vignettes of whatever command or program is giving you trouble.

Check for typos!  
Read the error message and make sure you understand it  
Google the error message, exactly

The quickest way to figuring out what went wrong is looking at the output you did get, comparing it to what you wanted, and thinking about how the program may have produced that output instead of what you wanted.

How to effectively ask questions on forums  
Details to include:  
The question you are trying to answer  
How you approached the problem, what steps you have already taken to answer the question  
What steps will reproduce the problem (including sample data for troubleshooters to work from!)  
What was the expected output  
What you saw instead (including any error messages you received!)  
What troubleshooting steps you have already tried  
Details about your set-up, eg: what operating system you are using, what version of the product you have installed (eg: R, Rpackages)  
Be specific in the title of your questions!

Better:  
R 3.4.3 lm() function produces seg fault with large data frame (Windows 10)  
Applied PCA to a matrix - what are U, D, and Vt?

Even better:  
R 3.4.3 lm() function on Windows 10 – seg fault on large dataframe  
Using principle components to discover common variation in rows of a matrix, should I use, U, D or Vt?
