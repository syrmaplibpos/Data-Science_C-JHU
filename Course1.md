#### What is data science


* Data science is using data to answer questions.
Data science can involve:
Statistics, computer science, mathematics
Data cleaning and formatting
Data visualization

* Data scientist is someone who use data to answer questions.
An Economist Special Report sums up this melange of skills well - they state that a data scientist is broadly defined as someone:
“who combines the skills of software programmer, statistician and storyteller slash artist to extract the nuggets of gold hidden under mountains of data”

#### What is data
* Two definitions of data, one that focuses on the actions surrounding data, and another on what comprises data. 
Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making. --Cambridge English Dictionary 
A set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables. --Wikipedia 
set: In statistics, the population you are trying to discover something out. 
Variable: Measurements or characteristics of an item 
Qualitative variables: Measurements or information about qualities 
described by words, not numbers, and they are not necessarily ordered. 
Quantitative variables: Measurements or information about quantities or numerical items 
described by numbers and are measured on a continuous, ordered scale 

* The relationship between data and your question and emphasize the importance of question-first strategies. You could have all the data you could ever hope for, but if you don’t have a question to start, the data is useless.
