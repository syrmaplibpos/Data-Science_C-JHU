#### Introduction
#### Overview and History
#### Getting help

* Asking questions

What steps will produce the problem

what is the expected output

what do you see instead

what version of the product (e.g. R, packages, etc.) are you using

what operating system

additonal information


* Smarter subject header

R.3.0.2 Im() function on Mac OS X 10.9.1 --seg fault on large data frame

* Wrong email example

Questions sent to wrong email list

email subject was very vague 

question was very vague

problem was not producible

no evidence of any effort made to solve the problem

result: recipe for diaster

* Place to turn

class dicussion forum, fellow students

r-help@r-project.org

other project specific mailing lists (eric raymond: how to ask questions in a smart way)



#### R Console Input and Evaluation

```
> x<-5
> x
[1] 5
```

The [1] indicates that x(symbol) is a vector and 5 is the first element
